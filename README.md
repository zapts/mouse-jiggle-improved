# Improved Mouse Jiggler
This is a mouse jiggle application for Windows.  Prevents screen saver or system timeout.  It keeps track of whether 
the mouse has moved since the last time the jiggler has moved the mouse.  If it has, the jiggler doesn't move the mouse.
This helps to prevent unexpected mouse movement when the system is being used.
